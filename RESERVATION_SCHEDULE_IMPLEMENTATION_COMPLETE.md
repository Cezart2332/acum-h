# Reservation & Schedule Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented the reservation and schedule management functionality for both the merchant and client applications. The system now allows:

1. **Merchants (acoom-restaurants app)**: Manage restaurant schedules and view/manage reservations
2. **Clients (main app)**: View restaurant schedules and make reservations

## Changes Made

### Backend API (ASP.NET Core)

#### 1. Created CompanyHoursController.cs

- **Location**: `acoom-restaurants/backend/WebApplication1/WebApplication1/Controllers/CompanyHoursController.cs`
- **Features**:
  - GET `/api/companyhours/{companyId}` - Retrieve restaurant schedule
  - POST `/api/companyhours/{companyId}` - Save restaurant schedule
  - PUT `/api/companyhours/{companyId}/day/{dayOfWeek}` - Update specific day hours
  - Default schedule generation for new restaurants

#### 2. Updated CompanyHourDto.cs

- **Location**: `acoom-restaurants/backend/WebApplication1/WebApplication1/Models/CompanyHourDto.cs`
- **Changes**: Modified to use string DayOfWeek for better API compatibility

#### 3. Fixed ReservationController.cs

- **Location**: `acoom-restaurants/backend/WebApplication1/WebApplication1/Controllers/ReservationController.cs`
- **Features**:
  - Complete CRUD operations for reservations
  - Available time slots calculation
  - Business hours validation
  - Status management (Pending, Confirmed, Completed, Canceled)

#### 4. Updated Program.cs

- **Location**: `acoom-restaurants/backend/WebApplication1/WebApplication1/Program.cs`
- **Changes**: Fixed enum parsing for DayOfWeekEnum

### Merchant App (acoom-restaurants)

#### 1. Enhanced Schedule Management

- **Location**: `acoom-restaurants/app/schedule.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Interactive time picker for opening/closing hours
  - 24-hour operation toggle
  - Day-specific open/closed status
  - Real-time schedule saving to backend
  - Visual feedback for schedule changes

#### 2. Enhanced Reservation Management

- **Location**: `acoom-restaurants/app/reservations.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time reservation fetching from backend
  - Status filtering (All, Pending, Confirmed, Completed, Canceled)
  - One-click status updates
  - Customer information display
  - Special requests handling
  - Sorting by status priority and timestamp

#### 3. Added Dependencies

- **Package**: `@react-native-community/datetimepicker`
- **Purpose**: Professional time picker UI component

### Client App (Main Application)

#### 1. Enhanced Reservation Form

- **Location**: `screens/Reservation.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic user information loading from AsyncStorage
  - Available time slots display from API
  - Interactive time selection with visual feedback
  - Date validation (max 1 week ahead)
  - Real-time reservation submission
  - Improved error handling

#### 2. Enhanced Schedule Display

- **Location**: `screens/ScheduleScreen.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time schedule fetching from backend
  - Proper day-wise schedule display
  - 24-hour operation indicators
  - Closed day indicators
  - Fallback to default schedule if API fails

## API Endpoints

### Reservations

- `GET /api/reservation/company/{companyId}` - Get all reservations for a restaurant
- `GET /api/reservation/{id}` - Get specific reservation
- `POST /api/reservation` - Create new reservation
- `PUT /api/reservation/{id}` - Update reservation status
- `DELETE /api/reservation/{id}` - Delete reservation
- `GET /api/reservation/available-times/{companyId}?date=YYYY-MM-DD` - Get available time slots

### Company Hours

- `GET /api/companyhours/{companyId}` - Get restaurant schedule
- `POST /api/companyhours/{companyId}` - Save complete schedule
- `PUT /api/companyhours/{companyId}/day/{dayOfWeek}` - Update specific day

## Database Schema

### Reservations Table

```sql
- Id (int, primary key)
- CustomerName (string)
- CustomerEmail (string)
- CustomerPhone (string, nullable)
- ReservationDate (DateTime)
- ReservationTime (TimeSpan)
- NumberOfPeople (int, 1-20)
- SpecialRequests (string, nullable)
- Status (enum: Pending, Confirmed, Completed, Canceled, NoShow)
- CreatedAt (DateTime)
- UpdatedAt (DateTime, nullable)
- ConfirmedAt (DateTime, nullable)
- CompletedAt (DateTime, nullable)
- CanceledAt (DateTime, nullable)
- CancellationReason (string, nullable)
- Notes (string, nullable)
- CompanyId (int, foreign key)
- UserId (int, nullable, foreign key)
```

### CompanyHours Table

```sql
- Id (int, primary key)
- DayOfWeek (enum: Monday-Sunday)
- Is24Hours (bool)
- OpenTime (TimeSpan, nullable)
- CloseTime (TimeSpan, nullable)
- CompanyId (int, foreign key)
```

## User Workflow

### For Merchants:

1. **Schedule Management**:

   - Open schedule screen
   - Toggle days open/closed
   - Set specific opening/closing times
   - Enable 24-hour operation if needed
   - Save changes to backend

2. **Reservation Management**:
   - View all incoming reservations
   - Filter by status (Pending, Confirmed, etc.)
   - Update reservation status with one tap
   - View customer details and special requests

### For Clients:

1. **Making Reservations**:

   - Select restaurant from list
   - Choose date (up to 1 week ahead)
   - View available time slots
   - Select number of people
   - Add special requests
   - Submit reservation

2. **Viewing Schedules**:
   - Select restaurant from list
   - View weekly schedule
   - See opening hours for each day
   - Identify closed days

## Technical Features

### Error Handling

- Network failure fallbacks
- Input validation
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states

### Performance

- Efficient API calls
- Caching with AsyncStorage
- Optimized rendering
- Background API requests

### User Experience

- Smooth animations
- Haptic feedback
- Intuitive time selection
- Visual status indicators
- Responsive design

## Configuration

### Backend Configuration

- API base URL: `http://192.168.0.150:5298`
- Database: SQL Server with Entity Framework
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests

### Frontend Configuration

- Both apps use the same BASE_URL configuration
- Automatic user authentication handling
- Persistent storage for user sessions

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Reservation Flow**:

   - Create reservations from client app
   - Verify they appear in merchant app
   - Test status updates
   - Verify email/phone validation

2. **Test Schedule Management**:

   - Set different schedules for each day
   - Test 24-hour operation mode
   - Verify schedule saves persist
   - Test available time calculation

3. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Reservations outside business hours
   - Dates beyond 1 week
   - Maximum capacity handling
   - Network connectivity issues

## Deployment Notes

The backend API is now running and ready to handle requests. Both frontend applications can connect to the API to manage reservations and schedules in real-time.

The implementation provides a complete, production-ready reservation and schedule management system with proper error handling, validation, and user experience optimization.
