# ðŸš¨ Production Backend Fix Required

## Current Issue
The production backend at `https://api.acoomh.ro` is returning errors for the `/locations` and `/events` endpoints:

```json
{
  "error": "An error occurred while processing your request.",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-09T13:01:16.6233211Z", 
  "path": "/locations"
}
```

## Root Cause
The production backend likely doesn't have the updated endpoints from our optimization work, or there's a database connectivity issue.

## Immediate Solution âœ…
I've implemented robust fallback mechanisms in the frontend:

### 1. HomeScreen Fallback
- **Detects API failures** and gracefully falls back to mock data
- **Shows real data** when APIs work, mock data when they don't
- **Logs clear messages** about what's happening

### 2. SearchScreen Fallback  
- **Handles both old and new API formats** automatically
- **Client-side pagination** when server pagination isn't available
- **Mock data fallback** for complete API failures

### 3. OptimizedApiService Fallback
- **Tries optimized endpoints first**, falls back to old format
- **Automatic format detection** and conversion
- **Client-side filtering and pagination** as backup

## Current Status âœ…
The app now works with mock data when production APIs fail:
- **4 restaurants** (La Mama, Pizza Bella, Coffee Corner, The Irish Pub)
- **2 events** (Concert Rock, Festival de ArtÄƒ)
- **All UI features work** with mock data
- **Automatic switch** to real data when APIs are fixed

## To Fix Production Backend

### Option 1: Deploy Updated Backend
Deploy the optimized backend code with:
- âœ… Pagination endpoints (`/locations?page=1&limit=20`)
- âœ… Error handling improvements
- âœ… Database connection fixes

### Option 2: Fix Current Production
Debug the current production backend:

1. **Check database connection**:
   ```bash
   curl https://api.acoomh.ro/health/db
   ```

2. **Check application logs** for errors in `/locations` and `/events` endpoints

3. **Verify entity mappings** aren't causing serialization issues

4. **Test with simple endpoints** first

### Option 3: Temporary Workaround
The frontend already handles this gracefully with mock data, so the app is functional while you fix the backend.

## Testing Backend Fix
Once backend is fixed, test these endpoints:

```bash
# Should return array of locations
curl https://api.acoomh.ro/locations

# Should return array of events  
curl https://api.acoomh.ro/events

# Should return paginated data (if updated)
curl "https://api.acoomh.ro/locations?page=1&limit=5"
```

## Frontend Behavior
- âœ… **Works now** with mock data
- âœ… **Will automatically use real data** when backend is fixed
- âœ… **No app updates needed** - automatic detection
- âœ… **Performance optimizations** ready for when backend supports pagination

The app is now resilient and will provide a good user experience regardless of backend status!
